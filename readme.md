## 📘 Project Overview

In today’s fast-paced e-commerce environment, data plays a crucial role in managing inventory, pricing strategies, discounts, and customer experience.

This project performs an **end-to-end SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a real-world **Zepto grocery delivery dataset** to derive meaningful business insights related to:

- Product pricing and discounts  
- Stock availability and inventory risks  
- Revenue contribution by category  
- Product weight and unit economics  

The project closely mirrors **real responsibilities of a Data Analyst** working in retail, FMCG, or e-commerce organizations.

- Inefficient discount strategies

- Low-margin product prioritization  

A structured SQL analysis is required to convert raw catalog data into actionable business insights.
